It's harder than you think.  If you run into trouble, you can always purchase hints, which will give you a second or third actor from the same show as clues.  Think you know television?  Good luck!"

If you get it wrong, you can continue guessing, or ask for a hint.\n\nUsers can buy 5 hints for $0.99.  Each question has two additional hints available, so after two hints, it should stop them from using additional hints, and force the user to get it correct or give up.",
